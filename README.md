ABSTRACT:
 Severe flooding is one example of a natural disaster that can result in disastrous losses to property and human life. Unfortunately, the high processing and hardware requirements of these systems make it difficult to implement them in low-resource and low-cost situations. By analyzing all of the data and extracting the water level information on an edge computing device, the quantity of data that needs to be sent to the cloud server is significantly decreased. The enormity and unpredictability of floods are known to result in disastrous losses and disturbances to our everyday existence.  Authorities will be able to minimize the disruptions caused by flooding by taking prompt preventive and corrective action if they have access to real-time information on flood risk and conditions.
